### Project Overview

The project focuses on building a semantic search engine using two key components: Sentence-BERT for semantic sentence embeddings and FAISS for efficient similarity search.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to install the required Python packages, namely `faiss-cpu` and `sentence-transformers`. This can be done using the provided `pip install` commands.

### Data

The project utilizes a dataset called "abcnews-date-text.csv," which presumably contains news headlines. The Pandas library is employed to load and inspect the dataset.

### Text Preprocessing

To enhance the quality of semantic understanding, the NLTK library is used for text preprocessing. This involves steps such as converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, eliminating stopwords, and applying stemming. The goal is to create a cleaner and more uniform representation of the textual data.

### Sentence Embeddings with Sentence-BERT

The SentenceTransformer library is employed to convert the preprocessed text into semantic embeddings. Specifically, the "distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens" model is used for this purpose. The resulting embeddings are then saved to a file for later use.

### FAISS Indexing

FAISS, a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, is utilized to index the high-dimensional semantic vectors produced by Sentence-BERT. An IndexIVFFlat instance is created, trained with the encoded data, and then saved to a file named 'abc_news.'

### Semantic Search

The project provides a search function that takes a user query as input. The query undergoes the same preprocessing steps as the dataset. The preprocessed query is then encoded using the Sentence-BERT model. FAISS is employed to perform a similarity search against the indexed data, and the results are formatted to include similarity scores, publication dates, and a "hot word" (a common word among the search results).

### Example Searches

The user is prompted to enter a search query, and the search function is executed to provide relevant results based on semantic similarity. The results include the matched headlines, their similarity scores, publication dates, and a hot word.

### Conclusion

In summary, this project showcases the implementation of a semantic search engine, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing and efficient vector similarity search. The combination of Sentence-BERT and FAISS allows for accurate and quick retrieval of semantically similar text based on user queries.
